        <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
        <p>Javascript is a cross-platform, object oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. 
            It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. 
            JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these enironments to provide
            programmatic control over them. 
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="underline">Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds coffee, a variable
            holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="purple">var x;</span></li>
            
            <li><span class="underline">Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our 
            variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="purple">var x = 10;</span></li>
            
            <li><span class="underline">Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.
            There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="purple">true</span> or <span class="purple">false;</span> null - <span class="purple">null</span>
            aka nothing; Number - <span class="purple">42</span> or <span class="purple">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span>
            Array - <span class="purple">[1, 'Coding', 2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="purple">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></li>
            
            <li><span class="underline">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different
            code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following
            conditionals statements: <span class="purple">if</span> a specified condition is ture, do this code in our code block; <span class="purple">else if</span> to a 
            specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="purple">else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
            
            <li><span class="underline">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: 
            they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the trac four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
            
            <li><span class="underline">Function</span> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. 
            Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started,
            first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a tone more
            tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
        </ul>
